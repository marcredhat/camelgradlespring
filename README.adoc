== Project goals

“One click” build automation (Gradle) to *expose SAP legacy systems using REST API calls and Fuse/Camel routes*.

Example: instead of 
connecting directly to SAP legacy systems and 
using the well-known *SFLIGHT* model via *ABAP*, (available as default sample content in ABAP systems), 
you just `curl http://localhost:8080/camel/SAPLegacyFlights`

You can easily add other REST endpoints and  more complex Camel routes that fit your Enterpise Integration requirements.

Also, teams that create the Camel routes / Sagas can operate independently from teams working on the SAP backends.

See more under link:#how-to-contribute["How to contribute"].

*Video demo* at http://bit.ly/2WlJq3C


== Use cases

Exposing SAP legacy systems using REST APIs/ Fuse/ Camel routes enables use cases s.a.


*Coordinate actions in remote SAP and non-SAP services in order to obtain a consistent outcome*

Example: For any trip from A to B, a travel agency should buy tickets for all sub-routes (train or flight) that take the customer from A to B, or none of them. 

See http://bit.ly/2MpvKQG



*Full API lifecycle management, charge back/monetization, security for  APIs created via this project as well as for APIs from api.sap.com* 

See videos at http://bit.ly/2L0omu7



*Integration with hundreds of systems*

See https://red.ht/2MlvbXR



*Machine Learning use cases*
where the customers want their pre-trained ML models to be closer to their apps/workloads (e.g. for security reasons, to avoid calls to external systems).

Calling a pre-trained ML model can be a simple API call, from any customer app, Fuse etc

See http://bit.ly/2Mpt1H2 and https://github.com/marcredhat/containerized_ml_models/blob/master/Dockerfile_ubi8_minimal
 


== Main benefits
Enable cloud-native developers with no ABAP experience to build applications and integrations using modern tools including Gradle, Groovy, Spring and Camel.
 
Enables building from user-specified versions of Camel/Spring/SAP connectors etc, making it  easy to test/upgrade different combinations (thanks to Gradle).


== SAP systems used for testing
SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and SAP BW 7.5 SP01 on SAP HANA SP10 [Developer Edition] from cal.sap.com



== Basic installation instructions
A file called *SAPConnectionInfo.jcoDestination* needs to be present at the root of the folder from which you are starting the app

Example of _SAPConnectionInfo.jcoDestination_

	jco.client.lang=en
	
	jco.client.client=001
	
	jco.client.passwd<SAP password>

	jco.client.user=<SAP username>
	
	jco.client.sysnr=00
	
	jco.client.ashost=<IP address of SAP instance>
	
	#Pool properites from the JCo v3
	#Maximum number of active connections that can be created for a destination simultaneously
	jco.destination.peak_limit=10

	#Maximum number of idle connections kept open by the destination.
	#A value of 0 has the effect that there is no connection pooling.
	jco.destination.pool_capacity=10

	#Time in ms after that the connections hold by the destination can be closed
	jco.destination.expiration_time=60000

	#Period in ms after that the destination checks the released connections for expiration
	jco.destination.expiration_check_period=60000
	
	#Max time in ms to wait for a connection, if the max allowed number of connections is allocated by the application
	jco.destination.max_get_client_time=60000


*Download the SAP connector files from https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/jco.html*

Perform basic validation as follows:

*Adapt build.gradle to your environment*

In build.gradle:

Find `compile fileTree(dir: '/home/marc/sap', include: '*.jar')` and

Replace `/home/marc/sap` with the folder where you have the SAP connector files (https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/jco.html)


== Basic usage instructions


*Running the app*


    git clone https://github.com/marcredhat/camelgradlespring.git


    cd camelgradlespring/


create the _SAPConnectionInfo.jcoDestination_ file (example above)

----
./gradlew bootRun
----

*Tests*

    curl http://localhost:8080/camel/SAPLegacyFlights


    curl http://localhost:8080/camel/test


*Use Gradle to generate an _uberjar_*


    git clone https://github.com/marcredhat/camelgradlespring.git


    cd camelgradlespring/


    ./gradlew bootJar

The _uberjar_ is created under `build/libs`

Copy the SAP Connector _.jar_ and _.so_ files to `build/libs` (where Gradle generated the _uberjar_):

Copy the jcoDestination file to `build/libs`


The end result should look like:

*pwd*

    /home/marc/gradlecamelsap/camelsapdemo/build/libs

*ls -A1*

    camelsapdemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

    libsapjco3.so

    SAPConnectionInfo.jcoDestination

    sapidoc3.jar

    sapjco3.jar


Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the folder where you have the SAP Connector files
(e.g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/marc/sap` in your `~/.bashrc`)


You can now run the _uberjar_:

----
java -jar camelsapdemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== How to contribute

This project is using https://camel.apache.org/rest-dsl.html to build REST endpoints as consumers for Camel routes.

See link:src/main/groovy/SomescriptsApplication.groovy[] to see how we create the _/SAPLegacyFlights_ REST endpoint.

You can easily use this as a bluprint to add complex Enterprise Integration Patterns / Sagas.  See http://bit.ly/2MpvKQG and https://red.ht/2MlvbXR. 

In the same source file, note that the Camel route calls _getBean("SAPLegacy").getFlights()_ to get the information from the actual SAP backend system.

You'll find link:src/main/resources/beans.xml[beans.xml], link:src/main/resources/SAPLegacy.groovy[SAPLegacy.groovy], link:src/main/resources/SAPLegacyImpl.groovy[SAPLegacyImpl.groovy] under link:src/main/resources[].

Finally, have a look at link:src/main/groovy/groovysap/src/com/cordjastram/groovysap/example/Example1.groovy[] and see how the function _rfcReadTable()_ uses the class _GContext_
to connect to the SAP backend using the _SAPConnectionInfo.jcoDestination_ file that we place in the root of the folder from which we are starting the app.

*So, you can easily add other REST endpoints and  more complex Camel routes that fit your Enterpise Integration requirements. 
Also, teams that create the Camel routes / Sagas can operate independently from teams working on the SAP backend
(once interfaces are agreed upon, see link:src/main/resources[]).*
